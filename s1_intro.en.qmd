# SECTION 1: Introduction to urban accessibility

**The purpose of this** section is (1) to present the concept of urban accessibility, clarifying the difference between accessibility and mobility, and (2) to present an overview of the main indicators used to measure accessibility levels. 

How many jobs can a person in a given location reach within an hour of travel using public transport? How long does it take for this person to get to the health center or the school closest to her home? The answers to these questions depend directly on local transport and urban development policies. These policies determine the levels of urban accessibility in each city - that is, the ease with which each individual can access opportunities such as employment, health and education services, cultural and leisure activities, among other types of activities. Accessibility is simultaneously a result of the connectivity and performance of transport systems and the organization of cities in terms of the spatial distribution of the population, economic activities, and public services. Moving to accessibility-focused transport planning can help promote more sustainable and inclusive urban development. Throughout this section, we will understand in more detail the concept of urban accessibility, why it is important to understand how cities function and what indicators are most commonly used to measure accessibility levels.
